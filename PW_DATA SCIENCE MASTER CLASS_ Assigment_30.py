# ## Q1. What is Statistics?
# 
# ### Ans:-
#         Statistics is the science of collecting,organizing and analyzing the data. It involves the use of various methods
#         and techniques to gather and analyze numerical data, and then draw conclusions or make predictions based on that
#         data.
# 
# 

# ## Q2. Define the different type of statistics and given an example of when each type might be used?
# 
# ### Ans:-
#             There are two main type of statistics
#             
#             1. Descriptive Statistics
#             2. Infrenctial Statistics
#             
#         Descriptive Statistics :- It Consist of analyzing,summarizing,organizing data in the form of Numbers and graphs.

#                   
#         Example :- A company collects data on the number of hours their employees work per week. Descriptive statistics 
#                    would be used to calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the number of hours worked to 
#                    describe the typical workweek of the employees.
#                  
#        Infrential Statistics:- Technique where we used the data that we have measured to form of conslusion.
#                Part of Infrential Statistics------
#                   a) Hypothesis Test.
#                   b) Z-Test

#                   
#       Example :-A researcher wants to know if a new drug is effective in treating a particular medical condition. 
#                 They would select a random sample of patients with the condition and give half the drug and the other 
#                 half a placebo. Inferential statistics would be used to analyze the data from the two groups and draw 
#                 conclusions about the effectiveness of the drug for the larger population of people with the condition.
#

#      iv) Number of mangoes exported by farm : [500,600,478,672,...]---Quatative
#      
#      

# ## Q4. Explain the concept of levels measurement and give an example of a variable for each level.
# 
# ### Ans:-
# 
#         Levels of measurement, also known as scales of measurement.
#         There are four main levels of measurement: 1)nominal, 2)ordinal, 3)interval, and 4)ratio.
#         
#         1.Nominal level:- Nominal level data are categorical data that are used to classify or categorize objects or 
#                           events. This level of measurement involves assigning numbers or labels to items without any
#                           quantitative meaning.
#           
#           Example: Types of fruit such as apples, bananas, and oranges can be classified using nominal level data. 
#                    Each fruit is assigned a label or number, but there is no inherent order or relationship between
#                    them.
#           
#         2.Ordinal level:- Ordinal level data are used to rank or order items based on a particular characteristic or
#                           attribute. This level of measurement involves assigning numbers to items in a way that reflects
#                           their relative position or order.
#                           
#           Example: Ranking students in a class from highest to lowest based on their grade point average is an example of 
#                    ordinal level data. The ranking is based on the order of the students' GPAs, but the difference between
#                    each ranking may not be equal.
#                    
#        3.Interval level:- Interval level data involves the use of numerical data with equal intervals between each value. 
#                           This level of measurement involves assigning numbers to items in a way that reflects their 
#                           relative magnitude and the difference between each value is meaningful.
#                           
#           Example: Measuring temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit is an example of interval level data. The difference
#                    between 10 and 20 degrees Celsius is the same as the difference between 20 and 30 degrees Celsius.
#              
#        4.Ratio level: Ratio level data involves the use of numerical data with a true zero point. This level of measurement
#                       involves assigning numbers to items in a way that reflects their relative magnitude and the ratio 
#                       between each value is meaningful.
#                       
#          Example: Measuring weight or height is an example of ratio level data. A person's weight of 60 kilograms is twice 
#                   as much as a person who weighs 30 kilograms. Similarly, a person who is 180 centimeters tall is twice as
#                   tall as a person who is 90 centimeters tall.
#                   
#                    
#       
# 
# 

# ## Q6. Why is it important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data?provide an example to illustrate your answer.
# 
# ### Ans:-
# 
#             It is important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data because it determines the type of
#             statistical analyses that can be used and the appropriate interpretations that can be made from the data. 
#             Different statistical tests and analyses are designed to work with different types of data, and using the wrong
#             test can lead to incorrect conclusions and misleading results.
#             
#             For example, consider a study that measures the heights of students in a classroom. If the heights are measured
#             using a nominal scale, which simply categorizes individuals into groups without any numerical value, such as 
#             "short" or "tall," then it would not make sense to calculate the mean height or perform other statistical 
#             analyses that rely on numerical values. In this case, the best analysis would be to simply report the number
#             of students in each height category.
#             
#             On the other hand, if the heights are measured using a continuous scale, such as inches or centimeters, then it
#             would be appropriate to use statistical analyses that can handle continuous data, such as calculating the mean
#             or standard deviation. Using a nominal scale for continuous data would be inappropriate and would not provide 
#             meaningful results.
#             
# 
# 

# ## Q7. How Nominal data type is different from Ordinal data type.
# 
# ### Ans:-
# 
#     Nominal data refers to data that can be categorized into distinct categories or groups, without any inherent order or
#     ranking. Examples of nominal data include gender (male/female), race (Asian, Black, Hispanic, White), and favorite color
#     (red, blue, green). Nominal data can be counted and percentages can be calculated, but no meaningful mathematical 
#     operations, such as addition or multiplication, can be performed on nominal data.
#     
#     Ordinal data, on the other hand, is a type of data that can be ranked or ordered based on some criteria or attribute, 
#     but the intervals between categories are not necessarily equal. Examples of ordinal data include rank orders (first,
#     second, third), education level (high school, college, graduate school), and rating scales (poor, fair,good,excellent).
#     Ordinal data can be counted and ranked, and some mathematical operations such as median, mode, and percentiles can be
#     calculated, but not mean or standard deviation.
#        

# ## Q8. Which type of Plot cab be used to display data in terms of range?
# 
# ### Ans:- 
#      A box plot (also known as a box-and-whisker plot) is commonly used to display data in terms of range.

# ## Q9. Describe the different between descriptive and inferential statistics.Give an example of each type of statistics and example how they are used.
# 
# ### Ans:-
# 
#     Descriptive statistics refer to methods used to summarize and describe the important features of a dataset, such as its
#     mean, median, mode, standard deviation, range, and frequency distribution. Descriptive statistics are used to provide a 
#     concise and meaningful summary of a dataset, and can be used to identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data.
# 
#     An example of descriptive statistics is the calculation of the mean and standard deviation of a set of exam scores. 
#     These statistics can be used to describe the overall performance of the students in the exam,and to identify whether 
#     the scores are evenly distributed or skewed towards higher or lower values.
#     
#     Inferential statistics, on the other hand, refer to methods used to make inferences or predictions about a larger 
#     population based on a sample of data. Inferential statistics involve testing hypotheses, estimating population 
#     parameters, and calculating probabilities.
# 
#     An example of inferential statistics is a hypothesis test to determine whether a new drug is effective in treating a 
#     certain condition. A sample of patients is randomly assigned to receive the new drug or a placebo, and their outcomes
#     are compared. Based on the results of the study, researchers can infer whether the new drug is more effective than 
#     the placebo for the larger population of patients with the same condition.
# 

# ## Q.10. What are some common measures of Central tendency and variability used in statistics? Explain how each measure can be used to describe a dataset.
# 
# ### Ans:-
#      Measures of central tendency refer to the typical or average value in a dataset. The most commonly used measures of 
#      central tendency are:
#      
#      1.Mean: The mean is the sum of all values in the dataset divided by the number of values. The mean is a useful measure
#              of central tendency when the data is normally distributed and there are no extreme values (outliers) in the
#              dataset.
#      2.Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the data is arranged in order of magnitude. The median is a
#                useful measure of central tendency when the data is skewed or has outliers, as it is not affected by extreme
#                values.
#      3.Mode: The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. The mode is a useful measure of central tendency
#              when the data is categorical or discrete.
#              
#      Measures of variability, on the other hand, describe how spread out or dispersed the values in a dataset are. The most
#      commonly used measures of variability are:  
#      
#      1.Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. The range is a useful measure 
#               of variability when the data is evenly distributed.
#               
#      2.Variance: The variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean. The variance measures the variability
#                  of the dataset by comparing each data point to the mean, and then squaring and averaging the differences.
#                  
#      3.Standard deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. The standard deviation is a useful 
#                            measure of variability because it is expressed in the same units as the data, and it gives an
#                            indication of how tightly the data is clustered around the mean.
